  This project is a carbon intensity-aware scheduling website that helps users make more environmentally conscious decisions when running computational jobs.
          
 **What It Does:**
          
  Displays real-time carbon intensity data based on your region.

  Upload your job/file, and the system analyzes your task.

  Recommends the best time to run your job when carbon intensity is lowest.

  Estimates carbon savings based on your scheduling choices.
                                                                                    
  **Why It Matters:**
  
  Computational tasks consume electricity, and electricity has a carbon cost. By optimizing when these tasks run, especially during periods of low carbon intensity 
 (e.g. when more renewables are on the grid), we can help reduce unnecessary emissions without sacrificing performance.
